                            You’ve probably tried protein powders with incredible flavor names that unfortunately
                            sound better than they actually taste. And that’s always a let down. That’s why we
                            guarantee 100% True Whey™ won’t be one of those. Our flavoring experts nailed the
                            flavoring for you with The Whey, and we know you’re going to love it when you try it.

                        <p>When you’re choosing a protein powder, it’s important to choose one that you can trust
                            and feel safe using. That’s why The Whey is manufactured in a cGMP facility. This means
                            The Whey is produced under the absolute safest manufacturing conditions. And, it’s
                            guaranteed to be free of banned and adulterated substances

                        <h1>QUALITY YOU CAN TRUST</h1>
                        <p>Each scoop of The Whey delivers a minimum 4.9 grams of naturally occurring BCAAs and 3.8+
                            grams of glutamine precursors. These aminos can get stripped from your muscles during
                            intense workouts, making them crucial for recovery. Plus, The Whey provides 10.7+ grams
                            of Essential Amino Acids, and high levels of L-leucine to help kickstart muscle protein
                            synthesis and rebuild muscle.
